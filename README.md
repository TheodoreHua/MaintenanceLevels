*Edited from [cheerfulstoic's version](https://gist.github.com/cheerfulstoic/d107229326a01ff0f333a1d3476e068d)*  
Project was mostly designed for use within my own projects, but feel free to use this for your projects as well.

## Levels

### Actively Developed

- Responds to issues & questions

- Answers questions
- Not responding to issues
- Not integrating code contributions

### Not Maintained
The maintainer(s) are not around to work on this project and should offer to hand the project over.

- Not actively writing code for the project
- Not answering issues or questions

No matter your commitment to a project, it is in your user's interest to know the status of your projects (as well as in your own interest to not have to answer the question over and over).

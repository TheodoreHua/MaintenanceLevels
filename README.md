No matter your commitment to a project, it is in your user's interest to know the status of your projects (as well as in your own interest to not have to answer the question over and over).  To that end I have created these easy-to-copy badges for your repo's README which can all be linked back to this page.

After reading [Why I'm Frequently Absent from Open Source](http://jlongster.com/Why-Frequently-Absent-Open-Source) by James Long and listening the corresponding [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/242) episode, I dwelt on the idea and believe that open source maintainers...

 * ... should never be ashamed if they don't have time for a project.
 * ... should be honest with themselves and open with their users so that everybody can be on the same page
 * ... are people and they have at one time or another responsibilities or hardships that they need to attend to which reasonably take them away from a project
 * ... may also reasonbly decide that they don't like the direction of a project or that they would like to explore other things and may leave a project permanently.

Along this line of thinking I've created a set of descriptions for different levels at which a project might be maintained.  A maintainer can use these to announce to their users the current ability that they have to dedicate to a project (no more "Is this project still maintained?" issues!)
